       * Handling Nested Promises:
            If value is a promise (in this case, MyPromise), it means the promise might still be pending or it might need to resolve to another value (e.g., a value or another promise).
            To handle this, the then method is called on that promise to ensure that the resolution or rejection of this inner promise is passed along to the current (outer) promise.
       *
        // Example promise code to understand

            const promise1 = new Promise((resolve, reject) => {
                setTimeout(() => resolve(10), 1000); // if this rejects then (err)=> console.log(err) is called in then
            });

            const promise2 = new Promise((resolve) => {
                setTimeout(() => resolve(promise1), 500); // Resolves with promise1
            });

            promise2.then((value) => console.log(value), (err)=> console.log(err)); // Logs: 10
            

            Nested Promise (promise1):

            promise2 resolves with another promise (promise1).
            The native Promise implementation detects that the value passed to resolve is itself a promise (promise1).
            Automatic Chaining:

            Instead of immediately resolving promise2, JavaScript waits for promise1 to resolve.
            Once promise1 resolves, promise2 takes on the resolved value of promise1 (which is 10 in this case).

            You ensure:
                If value resolves, the current promise will resolve with the same value.
                If value rejects, the current promise will reject with the same error.

/**
 * 
 * The variables wasResolved and value are used to store the outcome of the previous promise (this.then(...)
 *  and this.catch(...)) before the finally callback completes, ensuring that the correct result 
 * (either resolved value or rejected error) is available after the finally block has executed.

    Hereâ€™s why they are necessary:

        Purpose of wasResolved and value:
        Preserve the Original Outcome:

            1.We need to remember whether the original promise was resolved or rejected before running the finally block, because finally does not change the outcome.
            2.The callback inside finally runs regardless of the result, but we need to return the original outcome afterward, whether it was a resolution (success) or rejection (error).
            3.Without storing the state (wasResolved) and the result (value), we would lose track of whether to call resolve or reject on the new promise being returned from finally.
            
        Separate Execution of the finally Callback:

            1.The finally callback executes after either the then or catch block. Since the result of the original promise (whether it was resolved or rejected) is important for continuing the promise chain, we store that information beforehand.
            2.The finally block executes independently of the original result, but once it completes, we need to know how to continue the chain: by resolving or rejecting the new promise based on what happened before finally.
        
        Detailed Breakdown of wasResolved and value:
            let wasResolved; // To store whether the promise was resolved or rejected
            let value;       // To store the resolved value or rejected error
            this.then((val) => {
                value = val;           // Store the resolved value
                wasResolved = true;    // Mark that the promise was resolved
                return callback();     // Execute the callback in `finally`
            })
            .catch((err) => {
                value = err;           // Store the rejection reason
                wasResolved = false;   // Mark that the promise was rejected
                return callback();     // Execute the callback in `finally`
            });

        Storing the result (value):
            In the then block, value holds the resolved value of the promise.
            In the catch block, value holds the rejection reason.
        
        Storing the state (wasResolved):
            In the then block, wasResolved is set to true, indicating that the promise was successfully resolved.
            In the catch block, wasResolved is set to false, indicating that the promise was rejected.

        Why Do We Need This?
            After the finally callback runs, we need to ensure that we either resolve or reject the new promise based on the original outcome.


        if (wasResolved) {
            resolve(value);  // Resolve the new promise with the original value
        } else {
            reject(value);   // Reject the new promise with the original error
        }

        If wasResolved is true: This means the promise resolved successfully, so we resolve the new promise with the stored value (the resolved value).
        If wasResolved is false: This means the promise was rejected, so we reject the new promise with the stored value (the rejection reason).

        Example Without Storing State:
            If we didnâ€™t store wasResolved and value, it would look like this:

            finally = (callback) => {
            return new MyPromise((resolve, reject) => {
                this.then((val) => {
                    return callback();
                }).catch((err) => {
                    return callback();
                });
                // Now what? We don't know if it was resolved or rejected!
            });
            };

            After running the finally block, we wouldnâ€™t know if the original promise was resolved or rejected because we didnâ€™t store the result anywhere.
            Therefore, we couldnâ€™t decide whether to call resolve() or reject() on the new promise.
            
            Summary:
                wasResolved and value are necessary to preserve the original result of the promise (whether it was resolved or rejected) before running the finally callback.
                This ensures that after finally finishes, the promise chain continues correctly, either with the original resolved value or the rejection error.
